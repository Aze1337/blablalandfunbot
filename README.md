#blablaland.fun skin changer bot






# What is this 
Basically , if you have all the skins on blablaland.fun. you could run this program with your account (by using the authentification cookie named "BBL_AUTH_SESSION" and be able to walk and talk normally with your skins changing. you could get all the attention you need! ha! actually, there's one fun thing about this, it's the fact that it makes you teleport and swim/climb in the air in some maps. it's just fun to experiment bugs by changing skins every few seconds.





# How To Use
- Put your cookie (BBL_AUTH_SESSION) on line 16 of Program.cs in the class constructor
- Make a file skins.txt with all the ids you want to switch from. if you have all the skins, put all the ids. if you want to switch only from one to another skin, then put two ids.
- Use proxies.txt if you can, I have noticed that sending http request to the website with the same ip would slow down your gameplay as it's limiting requests per single ip.
- More importantly , have fun. the site will be closed on january 12th
